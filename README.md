**A new version has been released for the current vMenu-Customz.**



###  _DISCLAIMER_

If you are going to use this version of vMenu-Customz, make sure you set "vmenu_individual_server_id" in your permission.cfg file. Otherwise, vMenu will fail to start. This value can be any ASCII character and no spaces (ie. the name of the server, random string of letters and numbers).
Make sure you also update your "vmenu_menu_toggle_key" and "vmenu_noclip_toggle_key". These have been changed to use [Keyboard Controls](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/input-mapper-parameter-ids/keyboard/)
This build of vMenu is the same as our v1.1.3.5 release, except now in a legacy mode.
Also, we will NEVER sell any of our code from this menu to anyone. Our menu is free, and it is easily accessible. And also, we don't support people stealing code and selling them off to their website while discrediting others. Thx.
